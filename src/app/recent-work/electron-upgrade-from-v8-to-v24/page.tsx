          . The app was stuck on version 8, which meant also that the Chrome
          version running in it was wildly outdated, causing several bugs in the
          application. I was tasked with updating the app to the latest version
          of Electron.

              Upgrading Electron directly from v8 to v24 would break the app,
              therefore I decided to update the dependency with increases of 1
              major version at a time. This allowed me to identify and fix the
              compatibility issues with the legacy code bit by bit, making it
              easier by looking at the Electron release notes.

              The security features in Electron changed drastically even just
              from version 8 to version 9 (

              ) and I carefully balanced security enhancements with
              compatibility requirements to deliver the update within project
              timelines.

              After a few weeks of intense work and several fixes, the app was
