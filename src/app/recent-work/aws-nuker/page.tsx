          , require to provision additional resources on AWS in order to create
          a viable environment to test the candidate&apos;s skills. Due to the
          inability to automatically delete unused / dangling resources on AWS,
          we saw a significant and steady increase in our AWS bill. The clean up
          process was manual, which was time-consuming and tedious. I was tasked
          with creating an automated solution to fix the problem.
